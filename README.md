# Sales_By_Ads

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **impact of different advertising channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) on product sales** using real-world advertising spend data. The goal is to identify the most effective channels and provide **data-driven recommendations for marketing budget allocation**.

---

## Dataset
- 200 records of advertising spend and sales data  
- **Features:** `TV`, `Radio`, `Newspaper` (spend in $k)  
- **Target:** `Sales` (units sold in $k)  
- Source: Classic Advertising dataset  

---

## Objective
- Determine which advertising channels contribute most to sales.  
- Recommend **budget allocation** to maximize sales and ROI.  
- Visualize relationships between ad spend and sales.  

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Loaded dataset and cleaned any missing values.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Checked correlations and trends.  
3. **Linear Regression:**  
   - Model: `Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper`  
   - Calculated **coefficients** to measure sales impact per $1k spent.  
4. **Visualization:**  
   - Plotted scatter plots of each channel vs sales with regression lines (Matplotlib for static plots).  
5. **Budget Recommendations:**  
   - Allocate budget proportionally to channels with highest positive impact (Radio > TV > Newspaper).  

---

## Key Findings
- **Radio ads** have the highest positive impact on sales per $1k spent.  
- **TV ads** also positively impact sales but less than Radio.  
- **Newspaper ads** have negligible effect.  
- **Actionable Recommendation:** Reduce Newspaper spend and reallocate to Radio and TV for higher ROI.
